The crypto space and the gaming space are both rife with bad practices and outright abuse of gamers. Unfortunately, the space is so new that governments still have trouble classifying what blockchain gaming is; they have not even considered the rights people should have whilst participating in blockchain gaming.
We fully believe in inclusion and that everyone in the crypto and gaming space should be treated with dignity and respect. 

By signing the pledge, companies and organizations commit to these three principal actions.

Treat everyone with dignity
Players have the right to be treated with dignity. Players should not be subjected to “interviews” or create “resumes” in order to play a game. Especially if a game is Play-to-Earn, the players should be able to simply sign in and play the game. If players are very good, their results will speak for themselves and they will be sought after, instead of needing to seek “work”.

Be Universal & Inclusive
The game and content should be universal, and should not intentionally exclude people by their race, language, nationality, etc. (Reasonable exceptions to this are when the country a game company is located in has export restrictions against certain countries and must block any interactions with those countries.)

Be Transparent
Gone are the days of anonymous companies creating never-before-seen products that must keep their anonymity. We now live in times where it takes countless hours of development, design, and community engagement to create a new product. As such, companies and game developers should make their identities, country of origin, legal status, etc. clearly known to all purchasers. Not only does this instill trust in the community, it also creates more accountability for those creating games and selling items.
